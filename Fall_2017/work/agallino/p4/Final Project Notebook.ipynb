    "# Final Project: Property Law Assistance\n",
    "By [Anthony Gallino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-gallino-182b3b45/) \n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project I created a chatbot to assist 1L students in understanding difficult property law concepts in the area of Landlord obligations and Rule Against Perpetuities. You can find the bot [here](final_bot.html). To write my bot, I used a tool called [QnA Markup](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). Basically, you create an interactive decision tree by nesting questions and answers. Here's [my code](final_bot.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem this project hopes to address is a law student's inital struggles to understand introductory property law concepts. As Teaching Assistant to a 1L property law course, as well as consulting with my partner, students confuse the following introductory property law concepts the most. Primarily students confuse the Rule Against Perpetuities and certain Landlord obligations to tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rule Against Perpetuities has long plagued the student and practioner. The teaching of the concept is difficult because of its abstract nature. The general rule is stated as such: No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. This rule often raises difficult questions: what is a life in being? What does it mean for an interest to vest? These are complex concepts that often trouble students. The RAP forces you to imagine a scenario where the rule is violated. That is an abstract and difficult task for many, practionar and student alike. \n",
    "\n",
    "A landlord's duties with respect to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, warrenty of habitability, constructive eviction, and actual partial eviction give are confusing, introductory aspects of property law that students seem to struggle with. These are often introductory concepts to property law. Quiet Enjoyment is generally when the landlord commits any interference with the tenant's right of enjoyment. This includes nusiance. Constrictive eviction is weh the premise is in such disrepair or so unusable the tenant is forced to leave the premise. Often these are cases of extreme health hazards, or a nusiance so great a tenant must leave. Warranty of habitability is often confused with quiet enjoyment because it has to do with the habitability of the apartment. The warrenty is broken when an essential necessity of the premise is inoperable and the landlord refuses to repair the item. Finally a claim for actual partial eviction will stand when there is any permenant physical encraochment onto the leased premise. The issue for students at this stage is their newness to property law concepts and that many of these concepts can overlap. Discerning when each claim is applicable and spotting the issue in a fact patern hypothetical is challanging and confusing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential users of this program are all first year law students with at least an introduction and cursury understanding of these topics, but are now trying to fully understand and internalize these concepts, advanced law students studying for the bar exam who need a quick refreasher but ultimately know and understand property law, and maybe some novice/early practioners that do not need a thorough understanding of the RAP or Landlord/tenant obligations, but want a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research\n",
    "\n",
    "I surveyed multiple law schools in the Boston area (Harvard, BU, BC, New England, North Eastern), and some in the Midwest (Iowa, Notre Dame, Case Western Reserve) that I thought might have some additional practice help. From what I saw, no law school had an equivalent chatbot, but often had papers or articles posted describing the RAP.  All of them made reference to John Chipman Gray and his work Rule Against Perpetuities and often Professor Barton Leach's Harvard Law Review article, Pertpetuties in a Nutshell. I did not think the traditional pdf, or hornbook would suffice. \n",
    "\n",
    "None seemed to have landlord/tenant obligations. There are many clinicls that deal with housing issues, but mostly in a descrimination context. Often there are chatbots to help individuals with practical housing issues regarding witholding rent, deposit issues, unlawful detainer issues, etc. They did not seem to specifically address basic common law concepts of landlord obligations. In addition, they were not designed for the first year law student, they were designed for a low-income tenant, with low levels (if any) of formal education.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also looked at [CALI](https://www.cali.org/) exercises. CALI does have an introductory lesson on both the RAP and on basic Landlord and Tenant obligations. They definitely helped me benchmark where CALI started and wanted to go. CALI is more expansive than this project, because this project focuses exclusively on topics where students have trouble. Whereas CALI really is a more broad coverage of the subject. Also many professors wait until students think they have an understanding of the concept, and then test themselves on CALI. This project is meant to assist students while they are learning the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convey the information about these subjects I turned to several textbooks. One was the course textbook Introduction to Property by Rabin, et. al. I also looked at Cases and Text on Property by A. James Casner and Barton Leach. I looked at [Perpetuities in a Nutshell](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1333874.pdf) by Professor Leach. I consulted my partner, Professor Janice Griffith, in office hours and Professor Charles Rounds, professor of Trusts and Estates. I also consulted A Hand Book on Trusts and Estates by Loring and Rounds for help on communicating the RAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately I thought of QnA Markup as a potential technical solution because web scraping, document automation, and data collection and analysis didn't seem to be applicable solutions. Similarly traditional soltions like basic articles or video recordings of a talking head seemed flat and passive. I considered doing a podcast students could listen to on their commutes to school where I just talked about the RAP and how to apply it. This still felt like it would just be more of the same type of attempts that had already been tried. The best solution seemed to be an interactive solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Working with another plateform (other than QnA) to create an interactive experience seemed overburdensome. I am familiar with QnA and I think it is something accessible to students. using a different technology-based program would have logistical issues as there is a time constraint for this project. Given the amount of time I had to complete the project and my existing experience with QnA, QnA was the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for how I decided to present the information I was most influenced by Professor Rounds. The Rabin, et al text book had a five-step process for analyzing the RAP, but Professor Rounds had a simple to use four-step system. I prototyped both and the simplest, most straight-forward one was Professor Rounds. If the goal was to alliviate student's confusion, and reduce RAP to its most component and necessary parts, a simplier design and methodology seemed to work best.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rabin's text did emphasize more the idea of examining each interest and what its contingencies were. RAP follows future interests in Professor Griffith's syllbus and so it makes sense that a larger emphisis is placed on examining contigencies. I was able to incorporate some of the language from the Rabin text in my description of RAP to remain consistent and to compliment Professor Griffiths curriculum and pedagogical approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Landlord Obligations I followed Rabin's description almost exclusively. The other texts I used were more in depth and complicated. Again, the goal was to be as simple and straight forward as possible and so the Rabin text fit well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before I wrote anything for the bot, I visited professor griffith to show her the language I wanted to use in the bot to describe the law. She had final approval of the language to correct for innacuracies and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For user testing I completed three rounds of testing. For two rounds, I asked a small group of 3-5 students that are in the class I TA for to use the bot to work through a simple RAP hypothetical I provided them. The hypothetical was O gifts to “A for life, remainder to A's children for their lives, remainder to B in fee.” This incorporated multiple contigencies and was a conveyance that appeared to be long, testing their confusion with the twenty-one years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. It was a common, real-world hypothetical that Professor Griffith might give on an exam. I conducted the test by asking the students to work through the hypothetical using the bot to see if the gift violated the RAP. I sat quietly and observed their experience clicking through the bot. Then after after they were done, I recorded whether they were successful in concluding whether the interest was valid. To conclude the test I asked if the group had any suggestions for improvements to the experience, be it the langugage or the flow of the questions. I recorded their verbal feedback in the form of notes. You can find my notes [here](). The bot I used for test one can be found [here]() The letter from my partner was email to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refinment\n",
    "\n",
    "User feedback is thoughtfully integrated into the final version of the solution (where the solution includes both the technical product and any documentation). At least two rounds of user testing were conducted with iterative improvements to the solution after each round. Use of multiple tests amount to more than testing for testing's sake. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Involves non-trivial use of at least two of the following: an expert system; document automation; data scraping from a data source not in the student’s control; a machine learning algorithm trained by the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Expands the reach of a single practitioner by more than 100 or decreases the amount of time expended on the automated task by more than 50%. Note: expanded reach must account for all work flowing from the solution such that this work will not result in new work for a practitioner. That is, it assumes the practitioner is already working at full capacity. So increased lead generation doesn’t count. More efficient selection of high-value clients, however, can count when this is reasonably projected to lead to a more than 5% increase in revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly addresses the stated problem for the stated user types such that it is reasonable to assume almost all users of any user type would find the solution a great improvement over the status quo in nearly all conceivable use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Well written and approachable for the overwhelming majority of potential users. Sufficient to address all likely user concerns as well as important edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready for real-world use as is. This includes a working technical solution and all supporting documentation. It need not include placement on a server or user authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clear plan for continued operation, updates, and maintenance, and the partner seems ready and willing to implement it. \n"
