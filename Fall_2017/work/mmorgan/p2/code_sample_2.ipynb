    "My twitter bot tweets out if the US flag is supposed to be at half staff for either a holiday, or by proclomation. From the website us.halfstaff.org it scrapes for country wide event date for the current or upcoming half-staff notification, and from flagnotify.com it scrapes for upcoming dates for flags at half-staff for particular states. It then tweets out the cominbed information including countrywide and state notifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scraping for us.halfstaff.org looks at the most recent posting for notifications and grabs the date. For flagnotify.com the bot scrapes the upcoming notifications for the top post for the date and state. Any changes to these and it should update the google sheet and send out a tweet with the new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both websites do not have any terms of use and do not restrict robot scraping.\n",
    "the robots.txt for halfstaff.org returned the results:\n",

    "I had many iterations of the bot scraping from different websites, but finally found two with the information I wanted in an available form. At first I scraped two parts of the us.halfstaff.org website for the information date, reason for the half-staff, and by whom it was declared, but without any new updates, the parse code I had for the declaration may not have worked, so instead I switched the second parse to individual states and had to get rid of the reason to shorten the tweet to be able to be sent, but added a link to more information on why it was to be half-staff.\n"

Trump Proclaims September 11, 2017, as Patriot Day\\r\\n\\r\\nPATRIOT DAY, 2017\\r\\n  \\r\\n BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\r\\n  \\r\\n A PROCLAMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Patriot Day, we honor the nearly 3,000 innocent lives taken from us on September 11, 2001, and all of those who so nobly aided their fellow citizens in America&#39;s time of need.  We rededicate ourselves to the ideals that define our country and unite us as one, as we commemorate all the heroes who lost their lives saving others.\\r\\n  \\r\\n September 11, 2001, will forever be one of the most tragic days in American history.  Through the unimaginable despair, however, ordinary Americans etched into our history remarkable illustrations of bravery, of sacrifice for one another, and of dedication to our shared values.  The shock from the indelible images of the smoke rising from the World Trade Center and Pentagon gave way to countless inspiring videos of co-workers helping one another to safety; of heroes running into collapsing buildings to save the innocent people trapped within; and to the unforgettable story of the patriots who charged the cockpit of Flight 93 to save untold numbers of lives.  These heroes moved us with their bravery.  They make us proud to be Americans. \\r\\n  \\r\\n Throughout history, everyday Americans and first responders have done the extraordinary through selfless acts of patriotism, compassion, and uncommon courage.  Not just in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, but across our great Nation, Americans on September 11, 2001, bound themselves together for the common good, saying with one voice that we will be neither scared nor defeated.  The enemy attempted to tear at the fabric of our society by destroying our buildings and murdering our innocent, but our strength has not and will not waiver.  Americans today remain steadfast in our commitment to liberty, to human dignity, and to one another.  \\r\\n  \\r\\n It has been 16 years since the tragedy of September 11, 2001.  Children who lost their parents on that day are now parents of their own, while many teenagers currently in high school learn about September 11th only from their history books.  Yet all Americans are imbued with the same commitment to cause and love of their fellow citizens as everyone who lived through that dark day.  We will never forget.  The events of September 11, 2001, did not defeat us.  They did not rattle us.  They, instead, have rallied us, as leaders of the civilized world, to defeat an evil ideology that preys on innocents and knows nothing but violence and destruction.  \\r\\n  \\r\\n On this anniversary, I invite all Americans to thank our Nation&#39;s incredible service members and first responders, who are on the front lines of our fight against terrorism.  We will always remember the sacrifices made in defense of our people, our country, and our freedom.  The spirit of service and self sacrifice that Americans so nobly demonstrated on September 11, 2001, is evident in the incredible response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  The same spirit of American patriotism we movingly witnessed on September 11th has filled our hearts as we again see the unflinching courage, compassion, and generosity of Americans for their neighbors and countrymen.  The service members and first responders who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and in the years of service since would be proud of what we have all witnessed over these last three weeks and what will undoubtedly unfold in the coming months of recovery.  By protecting those in need, by taking part in acts of charity, service, and compassion, and by giving back to our communities and country, we honor those who gave their lives on and after September 11, 2001.\\r\\n  \\r\\n By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as \"Patriot Day.\" \\r\\n  \\r\\n NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2017, as Patriot Day.  I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.  I invite the Governors of the United States and its territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance.  I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\\r\\n  \\r\\n IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\\r\\n\\r\\nDONALD J.

It is a moment of collective reflection on the noble sacrifices of those who gave the last measure of devotion in service of our ideals and in the defense of our Nation.  On this ceremonious day, we remember the fallen, we pray for a lasting peace among nations, and we honor these guardians of our inalienable rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, we commemorate the centennial anniversary of America\\x92s entry into World War I.  More than 4.7 million Americans served during The Great War, representing more than 25 percent of the American male population between the ages of 18 and 31 at the time.  We remember the more than 100,000 Americans who sacrificed their lives during \\x93The War to End All Wars,\\x94 and who left behind countless family members and loved ones.  We pause again to pray for the souls of those heroes who, one century ago, never returned home after helping to restore peace in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Memorial Day we honor the final resting places of the more than one million men and women who sacrificed their lives for our Nation, by decorating their graves with the stars and stripes, as generations have done since 1868.  We also proudly fly America\\x92s beautiful flag at our homes, businesses, and in our community parades to honor their memory.  In doing so, we pledge our Nation\\x92s allegiance to the great cause of freedom for which they fought and ultimately died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer.  The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 2017, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer.  I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI also request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control.  I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\\r\\n\\r\\nDONALD J.

The following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on the Congress to declare war and \"make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.\" In that spirit, Americans came together to pay tribute to the victims, support the survivors, and shed the comforts of civilian life to serve in our military and fight for our Union. Each year on National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor those whose lives were forever changed that December morning and resolve to uphold the legacy of all who stepped forward in our time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the docks of Pearl Harbor to the beaches of Normandy and far around the world, brave patriots served their country and defended the values that have sustained our Nation since its founding. They went to war for liberty and sacrificed more than most of us will ever know; they chased victory and defeated fascism, turning adversaries into allies and writing a new chapter in our history. Through their service and unparalleled devotion, they inspired a generation with their refusal to give in despite overwhelming odds. And as we reflect on the profound debt of gratitude we owe them for the freedoms we cherish, we are reminded of the everlasting responsibilities we have to one another and to our country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn memory of all who lost their lives on December 7, 1941 -- and those who responded by leaving their homes for the battlefields -- we must ensure the sacrifices they made in the name of liberty and democracy were not made in vain. On this solemn anniversary, there can be no higher tribute to these American patriots than forging a united commitment to honor our troops and veterans, give them the support and care they deserve, and carry on their work of keeping our country strong and free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as \"National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2016, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>10/9/2016</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>10/9/2016</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half Staff in Honor of National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">Presidential Proclamation -- Fire Prevention Week, 2016\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 2016\\r\\n\\r\\n- - - - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\r\\n\\r\\nA PROCLAMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 1 million fires occur each year in the United States. Throughout the past decade, the number of fires -- and of resulting deaths and injuries -- has gone down. But residential fires still damage homes across our country, causing a higher percentage of fire deaths, injuries, and economic loss than any other fires, and wildfires continue to devastate our forests and threaten nearby homes and businesses. During Fire Prevention Week, we strive to increase our preparedness for fires and commit to giving dedicated firefighters the support they need to keep us safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment counts during a fire, and smoke alarms help save lives. However, many people do not know that their smoke alarms should be replaced every 10 years -- after 10 years, they tend to become unreliable. I encourage everyone to check the manufacturing dates of their smoke alarms to see if they need replacing. Families and businesses should also develop and practice evacuation plans in case of emergencies and should prepare communication strategies in case of a fire. All Americans can learn more about steps they can take to prepare for fires by visiting www.Ready.gov.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, we have experienced some of the most severe wildfire seasons in American history, including roughly 50,000 wildfires and over 9 million acres burned last year alone. Climate change exacerbates wildfire risks through drier landscapes and higher temperatures -- we must recognize the effects our changing climate has on fire risks and help fire professionals and community leaders take action to enhance community resilience against these risks. Last year, my Administration brought together fire chiefs from around our country to identify key lessons learned from fires at the wildland-urban interface and actions that can be taken to reduce the harm to people and property associated with wildfires in these areas, where fighting fires is especially complicated, expensive, and dangerous. We need to be smarter about where we build, and we must work to better understand how fires behave so our firefighters can work more safely and effectively -- we owe these heroic professionals nothing less.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis week presents opportunities for businesses, families, and communities to learn about ways to protect themselves in case of fire and helps raise awareness of steps we can all take to prevent fires. During Fire Prevention Week, we also pause to honor our first responders and firefighters, including those who have sacrificed their own lives to save the lives of people they had never met. Let us salute them and pay tribute to all firefighters whose bravery, sense of duty, and love of country make our Nation a stronger, safer place.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2016, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 9, 2016, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>9/28/2016</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>9/30/2016</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half-Staff for the Death of Shimon Peres</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">Presidential Proclamation -- Death of Shimon Peres\\r\\nDEATH OF SHIMON PERES \\r\\n- - - - - - - \\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \\r\\nA PROCLAMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a mark of respect for the memory of Shimon Peres, former President and Prime Minister of Israel, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on September 30, 2016.

They claim too many lives, destroy too many communities, and take too much of a toll on our economy -- and many incidents can be avoided with simple preventive measures. During Fire Prevention Week, we pledge to take precautionary steps to stop fires before they start, and we honor the sacrifices made by our Nation&#39;s courageous first responders who risk their lives to beat back these threats. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether residential or wild, fires can ignite anytime and anywhere and we can all play a role in preventing them. I urge all Americans to routinely test their smoke alarms, develop and practice fire evacuation plans at work and at home, and create family emergency communication plans in order to quickly locate loved ones in the event of any emergency. Additionally, I encourage everyone to act responsibly to prevent forest fires when outdoors, and to immediately report any signs of fire to their local fire department. More ways to avoid and respond to fires can be found at www.Ready.gov. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy Administration remains committed to aiding in efforts to responsibly respond to fires wherever they occur. This year, we called on the Congress to fix the way we pay for wildfire costs so we can more appropriately invest our resources in forest restoration and resilience -- making our land and infrastructure less vulnerable to fires in the first place. \\r\\n\\r\\nEach of us can do our part to practice fire safety and to support the dedicated volunteers and professionals who risk everything to protect our homes and communities. This week, let us pay tribute to the heroes who have lost their lives fighting fires, let us stand beside all who continue to serve in our firehouses, and let us rededicate ourselves to doing everything in our power to stop tragedies before they strike. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 4 through October 10, 2015, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 4, 2015, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences. \\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth. \\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA \\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>10/2/2015</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>10/6/2015</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flag to Half-Staff Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Roseburg, Oregon</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">\\r\\nPresidential Proclamation: Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Roseburg, Oregon\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \\r\\n\\r\\nA PROCLAMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a mark of respect for the victims of gun violence perpetrated on October 1, 2015, in Roseburg, Oregon, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, October 6, 2015.

But those who brought hate to our shores and smoke to our skies did not expect our country to emerge stronger, and our beacons of hope and freedom to shine brighter as a result. In the years since, we have stood strong as one people -- determined to further embolden our country\\x92s character with acts of endurance and strength; rebuilding and resilience; renewal and progress. In remembrance of the innocent victims who lost their lives and in honor of the families they left behind, let us continue to answer these heinous acts by serving our communities, lifting the lives of our fellow citizens, and spreading the hope that others tried to dim that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compassion that rose in the hearts and minds of the American people on September 11 still serves as the ultimate rebuke to the evil of those who attacked us. First responders who risked and gave their lives to rescue others demonstrated the unwavering heroism that defines our great Nation. Volunteers donated time, money, and blood to ensure wounds gave way to healing and recovery. Young people, raised until then in a time of peace, stepped forward to serve and defend us, and meet the threats of our time. And people from across our country and the world joined together in the days that followed to stand up and turn toward one another with open arms, making of a tragedy something the terrorists could never abide -- a tribute of hope over fear, and love over hate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we reflect on the lives we lost and pay tribute to the families who still live with extraordinary pain, let us resolve to continue embodying the American spirit that no act of terror can ever extinguish. I call on all Americans to observe this National Day of Service and Remembrance with acts of selflessness and charity. In doing so, we prove once again that the power of those who seek to harm and to destroy is never greater than our power to persevere and to build. I encourage everyone to visit www.Serve.gov to learn of the many opportunities available to give back to others and to reaffirm the fundamental truth that we are our brothers\\x92 and our sisters\\x92 keepers, and that we can forge a brighter future together.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we continue our unfaltering march forward, enduring in the perennial optimism that drives us and brightening the light that the darkness of evil can never overcome. We remember and yearn for the presence of the beautiful lives lost, and we recommit to honoring their memories by shaping the days to come -- in as stark a contrast as possible to those who took them from us -- with courage, liberty, and love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as \\x93Patriot Day,\\x94 and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized \\x93National Day of Service and Remembrance.\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2015, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\\r\\n\\r\\ntenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>7/21/2015</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>7/25/2015</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half-Staff Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Chattanooga, Tennessee</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\r\\n\\r\\nA PROCLAMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nOur thoughts and prayers as a Nation are with the service members killed last week in Chattanooga.

On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we recognize all those who have dedicated their lives to this vital task. With heavy hearts, we mourn the heroes taken from us only because they chose to serve, and we rededicate ourselves to carrying forward their noble legacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur law enforcement officers have extraordinarily tough jobs. They regularly work in dangerous environments and in difficult, high-tension situations. And they often face challenges deeply rooted in systemic problems and broader social issues. These professionals serve to protect their communities and strengthen their Nation, and they deserve to go home safely to their loved ones at the end of each shift. As President, I am committed to making sure America&#39;s dedicated police officers receive the support and recognition they have earned, and to doing all I can to protect those who protect us.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne important way to make policing safer and more effective is by continuing to enhance relations and trust between law enforcement and the neighborhoods they serve. This will make it easier and safer for police officers to do their jobs, and it will strengthen the places we live and work. This important task will require our Nation -- our communities, our law enforcement, and our leaders at every level -- to come together to commit to meeting this challenge and moving our country forward, block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood. As President, I firmly believe it is within our power to make progress in our time, and I am dedicated to partnering with all those who are willing to do this necessary work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Administration is taking concrete steps to implement the commonsense, pragmatic recommendations my Task Force on 21st Century Policing put forward based on input from law enforcement personnel as well as criminal justice experts, community leaders, and civil liberties advocates. And we are engaging with local jurisdictions so they can begin to make the changes that will help ensure that police officers and their communities are partners in battling crime and that everyone feels safe on and off the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Nation&#39;s police officers are mentors in our schools, familiar faces on the corner, and pillars of our communities. They keep our borders secure and our roads safe, and in times of crisis, they rush toward tragedy. They are hardworking mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons who have dedicated their lives to public service, working every day to build a brighter future for their families and their Nation. Their selfless commitment and daily sacrifice represent what is possible for every city, town, and reservation in America, and our country has an enormous opportunity to lift up the very best law enforcement personnel as examples -- not just to other officers, but to all who aspire to lives of good citizenship. This week and every week, let us remember the patriots who laid down their lives for ours and honor all who strive to make our Nation more safe, more free, and more just.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as \"Peace Officers Memorial Day\" and the week in which it falls as \"Police Week.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2015, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 10 through May 16, 2015, as Police Week.

At a time when America was torn apart and our very future was in doubt, he knew our country was more than a collection of States, and that we shared a bond that would not break. One hundred fifty years after President Lincoln&#39;s death, Americans join together across the Union he saved to honor his memory and celebrate the freedom for which he gave his last full measure of devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nA self-taught man, rugged rail-splitter, and humble lawyer from Springfield, Illinois, President Lincoln believed in the fierce independence that lies at the heart of the American experience. But he also knew that together, we can do great things -- that it is through the accumulated toil and sacrifice of ordinary women and men that our country is perfected and our liberty preserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPresident Lincoln understood the immense sacrifices required to give meaning to our founding principles. With enduring faith and steady resolve, he led our Nation through Civil War, knowing the blood shed was in painful service to those same ideals. He sought to reunite our people not only in Government, but also in a freedom that knew no bounds of color or creed. It was in this spirit that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, forever joining the cause of our Union with the advancement of liberty. As our Nation gave birth to a new era of freedom, President Lincoln charted a course that would help bind the wounds of a divided country and bring healing to a people who desperately needed it.\\r\\nEven while his Presidency was characterized by war, his ambition was a just and lasting peace. Amid the discord of great conflict, President Lincoln demonstrated the wisdom to look forward. He knew a united America could serve the hopes of all its people if they seized the opportunity of their time. He established land-grant colleges and committed to a railroad connecting East to West, even as he fought to hold together North and South. He fueled new enterprises with a national currency, spurred innovation, and ignited America&#39;s imagination with a National Academy of Sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAs we reflect on the Great Emancipator, we are reminded that we will be remembered for what we choose to make of the moment we are given. President Lincoln has passed on a tremendous legacy to us, and we too are called to do great things. His example gives us confidence that whatever trials await us, this Nation and the freedom we cherish can, and will, prevail. Today, we reflect on the extraordinary progress he made possible, and with one voice, we rededicate ourselves to the work of ensuring a Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15, 2015, as a Day of Remembrance for President Abraham Lincoln. I call upon all Americans to honor his life and legacy with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also call upon the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on the Day of Remembrance for President Abraham Lincoln. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand fifteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>12/7/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>12/7/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half-Staff in Honor of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">US Flags at Half-Staff in Honor of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>10/12/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>10/12/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half-Staff in Honor of Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">Presidential Proclamation -- Fire Prevention Week, 2014\\r\\nFIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\n- - - - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\r\\n\\r\\nA PROCLAMATION\\r\\n\\r\\nFires can take lives, devastate communities, and destroy our homes and businesses. They pose a threat to Americans across our Nation, and they cost us billions of dollars each year. As we mark Fire Prevention Week, we emphasize the importance of taking steps to prevent fires, and we recognize the selflessness of those who answer the call to fight these blazes, placing themselves in danger to help others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Americans can protect themselves by taking precautions to guard against fires. This week&#39;s theme, \"Smoke Alarms Save Lives: Test Yours Every Month,\" reminds us of the importance of installing and maintaining smoke alarms in the places we live and work. Powerful and unpredictable, fire spreads rapidly and widely. That is why I encourage every American to develop and practice fire evacuation plans that will allow for swift exits from regularly visited places. It is our responsibility to teach our children about fire prevention and do everything we can to protect our loved ones during these emergencies. To learn more about fire safety, visit www.Ready.gov.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, our Nation has suffered tragic losses as wildfires ravage States across our country. As wildfires increase in frequency and intensity in a changing climate, fire prevention and planning only become more urgent. My Administration continues to take action to increase our Nation&#39;s preparedness and resiliency, and every person can do his or her part. Americans who live near woodlands should clear flammable vegetation away from homes and buildings, and everyone can be ready by making an emergency kit and discussing evacuation routes and emergency plans with their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe owe a great debt to our brave first responders and firefighters who run toward the scene of a disaster to fight fires. They are heroes who demonstrate courage, determination, and professionalism every day as they battle flames and smoke and teach their neighbors how to protect themselves. During Fire Prevention Week, we recognize our duty to be vigilant and take action to avert fires, and we remember the sacrifices of those who gave their lives so others might live.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim October 5 through October 11, 2014, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 12, 2014, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-ninth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBARACK OBAMA\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>9/11/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>9/11/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags at Half Staff for Patriot Day</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">President Obama has ordered US flags to half-staff in honor of Patriot Day.</div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>5/26/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>5/26/2014</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags to Half Staff for Memorial Day</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\">Memorial Day, which is observed on the last Monday of May, commemorates the men and women who died while in the military service.

Our Nation\\x92s peace officers embody the very idea of citizenship \\x97 that along with our rights come responsibilities, both to ourselves and to others. During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived. With unflinching commitment, they defended our schools and businesses. They guarded prisons; patrolled borders; and kept us safe at home, on the road, and as we went about our lives. To their families, we owe an unpayable debt. And to the men and women who carry their mission forward, we owe our unyielding support.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Nation has an obligation to ensure that as police officers face untold risks in the line of duty, we are doing whatever we can to protect them. This means providing all necessary resources so they can get the job done, hiring new officers where they are needed most, and investing in training to prepare those on the front lines for potentially deadly situations. It also means making reforms to curb senseless epidemics of violence that threaten law enforcement officers and haunt the neighborhoods they serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as police officers never let down their guard, we must never let slide our gratitude. We should extend our thanks not only in times of tragedy, but for every tragedy averted \\x97 every accident avoided because a patrol officer took a drunk driver off the streets, every child made safer because a criminal was brought to justice, every life saved because police officers raced to the scene. In other words, we must show our gratitude every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as \\x93Peace Officers Memorial Day\\x94 and the week in which it falls as \\x93Police Week.\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2014, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 11 through May 17, 2014, as Police Week.

Because of their extraordinary valor, America emerged from this test as we always do -- stronger than ever before.</p>\\r\\n<p>We also celebrate those who served and sacrificed on the home front -- from families who grew Victory Gardens or donated to the war effort to women who joined the assembly line alongside workers of every background and realized their own power to build a brighter world.

His own struggle inspired others to believe in the promise of a better world, and the rightness of reconciliation.

His journey from a prisoner to a President embodied the promise that human beings &mdash; and countries &mdash; can change for the better. His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the life of nations or our own personal lives.</p>\\r\\n<p>While we mourn his loss, we will forever honor Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s memory.

With broad vision and soaring but sober idealism,  President John F. Kennedy had called a generation to service and  summoned a Nation to greatness. Today, we honor his memory and celebrate  his enduring imprint on American history.</p>\\r\\n<p>In his 3 years as President of the United States, John F. Kennedy  weathered some of the most perilous tests of the Cold War and led  America to the cusp of a bright new age. His leadership through the  Cuban Missile Crisis remains the standard for American diplomacy at its  finest. In a divided Berlin, he delivered a stirring defense of freedom  that would echo through the ages, yet he also knew that we must advance  human rights here at home. During his final year in office, he proposed a  civil rights bill that called for an end to segregation in America. And  recognizing women&rsquo;s basic right to earn a living equal to their  efforts, he signed the Equal Pay Act into law.</p>\\r\\n<p>While President Kennedy&rsquo;s life was tragically cut short, his vision  lives on in the generations he inspired &mdash; volunteers who serve as  ambassadors for peace in distant corners of the globe, scientists and  engineers who reach for new heights in the face of impossible odds,  innovators who set their sights on the new frontiers of our time. Today  and in the decades to come, let us carry his legacy forward. Let us face  today&rsquo;s tests by beckoning the spirit he embodied &mdash; that fearless,  resilient, uniquely American character that has always driven our Nation  to defy the odds, write our own destiny, and make the world anew.</p>\\r\\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of  America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and  the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 22, 2013, as  a Day of Remembrance for President John F.

They inflict devastating tolls on families and communities, and they cost our Nation billions of dollars each year. During Fire Prevention Week, we pay tribute to the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to pull their neighbors out of harm&#39;s way, and pledge to do our part to prevent fires in our homes, our cities, and the great outdoors.</p>\\r\\n<p>We all have a responsibility to protect our families against fire. We should be cautious while cooking, using electrical appliances, and heating our homes. Those who live in areas prone to wildfires can help safeguard their homes by clearing flammable vegetation, and they should plan for emergencies by building a supply kit and talking with their families about a communications plan and evacuation routes. Every American should install working smoke detectors on each level of their home and remember to test them monthly. It is also essential to develop and practice evacuation plans twice a year. Because fire spreads rapidly and poisonous, disorienting smoke moves even quicker, families should design plans that allow for the quickest possible exit. To learn more about taking precautions against fires, visit <a title=\"www.Ready.gov\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/\">www.Ready.gov</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>By preventing fires, we can both protect our loved ones and keep America&#39;s firefighters out of unnecessary danger. To save people they have never met, these skilled professionals battle walls of flame, put themselves in the paths of unpredictable wildfires, and rush into houses on the verge of collapse. This week, as we renew our commitment to fire safety, we thank these courageous first responders for their service and honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.</p>\\r\\n<p jquery1380913696482=\"11\">NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim October 6 through October 12, 2013, as Fire Prevention Week.

They had been going about their day, harming no one, when sudden violence struck. We will never undo the pain and injustice borne that terrible morning, nor will we ever forget those we lost.</p>\\r\\n<p>On September 11, 2001, amid shattered glass, twisted steel, and clouds of dust, the spirit of America shone through. We remember the sacrifice of strangers and first responders who rushed into darkness to carry others from danger. We remember the unbreakable bonds of unity we felt in the long days that followed &mdash; how we held each other, how we came to our neighbors&rsquo; aid, how we prayed for one another. We recall how Americans of every station joined together to support the survivors in their hour of need and to heal our Nation in the years that followed.</p>\\r\\n<p>Today, we can honor those we lost by building a Nation worthy of their memories. Let us also live up to the selfless example of the heroes who gave of themselves in the face of such great evil. As we mark the anniversary of September 11, I invite all Americans to observe a National Day of Service and Remembrance by uniting in the same extraordinary way we came together after the attacks. Like the Americans who chose compassion when confronted with cruelty, we can show our love for one another by devoting our time and talents to those in need. I encourage all Americans to visit www.Serve.gov, or www.Servir.gov for Spanish speakers, to find ways to get involved in their communities.</p>\\r\\n<p>As we serve and remember, we reaffirm our ties to one another. On September 11, 2001, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family. May the same be said of us today, and always.</p>\\r\\n<p>By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as &ldquo;Patriot Day,&rdquo; and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized &ldquo;National Day of Service and Remembrance.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2013, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p>\\r\\n<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand thirteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-eighth.</p>\\r\\n<p>BARACK OBAMA</p></div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>5/15/2013</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>5/15/2013</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags to Flags to Half Staff in Honor of Police Officers Memorial Day</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\"><div class=\"rtecenter\">PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY AND POLICE WEEK, 2013</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">- - - - - - -</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div class=\"rtecenter\">A PROCLAMATION</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>Day after day, police officers in every corner of America suit up, put on the badge, and carry out their sworn duty to protect and serve. They step out the door every morning without considering bravery or heroics. They stay focused on meeting their responsibilities. They concentrate on keeping their neighborhoods safe and doing right by their fellow officers. And with quiet courage, they help fulfill the demanding yet vital task of shielding our people from harm. It is work that deserves our deepest respect -- because when darkness and danger would threaten the peace, our police officers are there to step in, ready to lay down their lives to protect our own.</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>This week, we pay solemn tribute to men and women who did. Setting aside fear and doubt, these officers made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the rule of law and the communities they loved. They heard the call to serve and answered it; braved the line of fire; charged toward the danger. Our hearts are heavy with their loss, and on Peace Officers Memorial Day, our Nation comes together to reflect on the legacy they left us.</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>As we mark this occasion, let us remember that we can do no greater service to those who perished than by upholding what they fought to protect. That means doing everything we can to make our communities safer. It means putting cops back on the beat and supporting them with the tools and training they need. It means getting weapons of war off our streets and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals -- common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence and help officers do their job safely and effectively.</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>Together, we can accomplish those goals. So as we take this time to honor law enforcement in big cities and small towns all across our country, let us join them in pursuit of a brighter tomorrow. Our police officers serve and sacrifice on our behalf every day, and as citizens, we owe them nothing less than our full and lasting support.</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as &quot;Peace Officers Memorial Day&quot; and the week in which it falls as &quot;Police Week.&quot;</div>\\r\\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\\r\\n<div>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2013, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 12 through May 18, 2013, as Police Week.

In less than 2 hours, the bombs that rained on Pearl Harbor robbed thousands of men, women, and children of their lives; in little more than a day, our country was thrust into the greatest conflict the world had ever known. We mark this anniversary by honoring the patriots who perished more than seven decades ago, extending our thoughts and prayers to the loved ones they left behind, and showing our gratitude to a generation of service members who carried our Nation through some of the 20th century&#39;s darkest moments.</p>\\r\\n<p>In his address to the Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt affirmed that &quot;with confidence in our Armed Forces -- with the unbounding determination of our people -- we will gain the inevitable triumph.&quot; Millions stood up and shipped out to meet that call to service, fighting heroically on Europe&#39;s distant shores and pressing island by island across the Pacific. Millions more carried out the fight in factories and shipyards here at home, building the arsenal of democracy that propelled America to the victory President Roosevelt foresaw. On every front, we faced down impossible odds -- and out of the ashes of conflict, America rose more prepared than ever to meet the challenges of the day, sure that there was no trial we could not overcome.</p>\\r\\n<p>Today, we pay solemn tribute to America&#39;s sons and daughters who made the ultimate sacrifice at Oahu. As we do, let us also reaffirm that their legacy will always burn bright -- whether in the memory of those who knew them, the spirit of service that guides our men and women in uniform today, or the heart of the country they kept strong and free.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as &quot;National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2012, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.

From the loss of a home to the tragic passing of a loved one, the devastation these disasters leave in their wake is heartbreaking. During Fire Prevention Week, we resolve to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from fires, and we honor the courageous first responders who put their lives at risk to keep us safe.</p>\\r\\n<p>All of us can take meaningful steps to reduce the risk of fire in our homes. I encourage all Americans to install and maintain smoke alarms, test smoke alarm batteries regularly, and follow safe practices in the kitchen and when using electrical appliances. Families should also develop and practice a fire escape plan that includes at least two ways out of every room. To learn more about these and other simple precautions against home fires, visit <a href=\"http://www.ready.gov/\">www.Ready.gov</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>This year, wildfires caused profound damage to communities across our country, and our Nation mourned the loss of life that followed. These events reminded us that wildfires are often unpredictable, which is why it is essential for people in areas at risk to practice proper fire prevention and preparedness. Those who live in regions prone to wildfire can take action by clearing flammable vegetation, preparing an emergency supply kit, and sharing evacuation routes and a communications plan with their family in case of emergency. Individuals who see a wildfire should report it by calling 911, and if advised, evacuate immediately.</p>\\r\\n<p>As we mark Fire Prevention Week by recommitting to preparedness, we also extend our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by fires this year -- including the brave first responders who fought them. Summoning courage in crisis and bringing discipline and professionalism to the job each and every day, America&#39;s firefighters are heroes in every sense. This week, we express our deepest gratitude for their service to our communities and our Nation, and we pay solemn tribute to the men and women who gave their lives to protect our own. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, and in their memory, let us rededicate ourselves to preventing tragedy before it strikes.</p>\\r\\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7 through October 13, 2012, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 7, 2012, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.</p>\\r\\n<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-seventh.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">BARACK OBAMA</p></div>\\r\\n        \\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"entry\">\\r\\n            \\t<div class=\"heading\">\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">START: <strong>9/12/2012</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"date\">END: <strong>9/16/2012</strong></div>\\r\\n                \\t<div class=\"short\">US Flags to Half Staff Honoring the Victims of the Attack in Libya</div>\\r\\n                    <div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\\r\\n                </div>                \\r\\n                <div class=\"long\"><p class=\"rtecenter\">BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">A PROCLAMATION</p>\\r\\n<p>As a mark of respect for the memory of John Christopher Stevens, United States Ambassador to Libya, and American personnel killed in the senseless attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, September 16, 2012.

Thousands of innocent men, women, and children perished when mighty towers collapsed in the heart of New York City and wreckage burned in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. They were family and friends, service members and first responders -- and the tragedy of their loss left pain that will never fade and scars our country will never forget.</p>\\r\\n<p>More than a decade later, the world we live in is forever changed. But as we mark the anniversary of September 11, we remember what remains the same: our character as a Nation, our faith in one another, and our legacy as a country strengthened by service and selflessness. In the spirit that moved rescue workers and firefighters to charge into darkness and danger that September morning, we see the same sense of moral responsibility that drove countless Americans to give of themselves in the months that followed. We offered our neighbors a hand and lined up to give blood. Many helped our Nation rebuild and recover long after the dust had settled, donating and volunteering and helping survivors who had borne so much. We were united, and the outpouring of generosity reminded us that, through challenges that have spanned from acts of terrorism to natural disasters, we go forward together as one people.</p>\\r\\n<p>Today, as we remember the victims, their families, and the heroes who stood up during one of our country&#39;s darkest moments, I invite all Americans to reclaim that abiding spirit of compassion by serving their communities in the days and weeks ahead. From volunteering with a faith-based organization, to collecting food and clothing for those in need, to preparing care packages for our men and women in uniform, there are many ways to bring service into our everyday lives -- and each of us can do something. To get involved and find a local service opportunity, visit <a href=\"http://www.serve.gov/\">www.Serve.gov</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.servir.gov/\">www.Servir.gov</a> for Spanish speakers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Even the simplest act of kindness can be a way to honor those we have lost, and to help build stronger communities and a more resilient Nation. By joining together on this solemn anniversary, let us show that America&#39;s sense of common purpose need not be a fleeting moment, but a lasting virtue -- not just on one day, but every day.</p>\\r\\n<p>By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as &quot;Patriot Day,&quot; and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized &quot;National Day of Service and Remembrance.&quot;</p>\\r\\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2012, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance.
