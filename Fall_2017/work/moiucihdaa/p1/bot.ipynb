    "\n",
    "I wrote a bot, and you can find it [here](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/moiucihdaa/p1/bot.html). To write my bot, we used a tool called [QnA Markup](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). Basically, you create an interactive dicision tree by nesting questions and answers. Here's [my code](bot.txt). \n",

    "## User Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we received feedback as to the flow and some of the information requested from the user.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "We added some new information requests and changed the flow up a bit so it felt more natural for the user.  Additionally, we altered some of the language a bit so it felt less like legal jargon and more like a conversation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Viability\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of real world viabilitiy, this is a tool that can help civil litigants prepare their application for fee waiver.  The information isn't determanitive"
