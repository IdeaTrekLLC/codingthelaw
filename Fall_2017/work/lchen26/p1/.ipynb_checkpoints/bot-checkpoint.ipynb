    "## Assigned Counsel and Fee Waiver Bot\n",
    "By lchen26 \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a bot, and you can find it [here](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.html). To write my bot, we used a tool called [QnA Markup](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). Basically, you create an interactive decision tree by nesting questions and answers. Here's [my code](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "## User Testing\n",
    "In This process, I did peer testing with my partner. My partner gave me this feedback:\n",
    "In addition, I had a lawyer go over the chatbot. Here was his feedback: \n",
    "\n",
    "[Feedback from Jeffrey Price](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/screenshotJeffPriceFeedback.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I reached out to a lawyer in Virginia for feedback. Here was his feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lawyer Feedback](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/screenshotJeffPriceFeedback.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I collected feedback anonymously. I used Google Forms and received these [results](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/feedback.xlsx) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research and Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine this, I did research into the relevant laws in Virginia. The two codes are [ยง 17.1-606](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/17.1-606/ \"Official Virginia Code on fee waiver process in civil cases\") and [ยง 19.2-159](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/19.2-159/ \"Official Virginia Code on determination of indigency (for appointment of counsel in criminal cases and fee waivers in civil cases)\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the feedback I received, I researched on the actual determination of the equivalent of Miranda rights in Virginia. In Virginia, the prerequisite of the appointment of counsel is [ยง 19.2-160](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title19.2/chapter10/section19.2-160/).\n",

    "I also added in a new photo: CC0 (no attribution needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Viability\n",
    "\n",
    "I am continuing to work on adapting based on feedback. To make it more viable, I would have a more robust set of values to be filled. Currently it only has a small list of values that are recorded, and to make it more viable, it would provide the option"
