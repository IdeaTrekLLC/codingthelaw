    "## Assigned Counsel and Fee Waiver Bot\n",
    "By lchen26 \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a bot, and you can find it [here](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.html). To write my bot, we used a tool called [QnA Markup](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). Basically, you create an interactive decision tree by nesting questions and answers. Here's [my code](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "## User Testing\n",
    "In This process, I did peer testing with my partner. My partner gave me this feedback:\n",
    "In addition, I had a lawyer go over the chatbot. Here was his feedback: \n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback from Jeffrey Price:\n",
    "Overall, great chatbot. Here is my feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single parent of 2 making $400 a week before taxes who is charged with a misdemeanor.\n",
    "            Chatbot response:  If the misdemeanor is one that has the potential for a jail sentence, then the client would probably qualify. If this misdemeanor doesn’t include the possibility of jail, then the client probably wouldn’t qualify. Need more information from the prompt to fully assess.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Individual making $275 a week before taxes who is charged with a felony assault against their spouse who makes $400 a week before taxes.\n",
    "            Chatbot response:  Assuming only the client’s income is used, they would qualify.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Juvenile (only child) whose parents make $800 a week after taxes who is charged with a misdemeanor.  \n",
    "            Chabot response:  Similar to test case 1, there is a distinction between misdemeanors with and without a possible jail sentence. However, in either case this client would not qualify.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Individual making $200 a week before taxes who is seeking divorce from their spouse who makes $800 a week before taxes.\n",
    "            Chatbot response:  Assuming only the client’s income is used, they would qualify.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Married parent of 4 (household of 6) who makes $400 a week before taxes involved in a civil matter. Their spouse makes $200 a week before taxes. \n",
    "            Chatbot response:  The client would probably qualify.\n",
    " \n",
    "- I like the “I don’t know” answer for the income question, and the subsequent direction for where to find the info.\n",
    "- Consider adding more detail for what income can be included. For example, in test scenarios two and four, if the client used total household income the chatbot would tell them they don’t qualify.\n",
    "- How would I know whether a misdemeanor I’m charged with carries the possibility of jail time? Could you point me to a list of charges that qualify, or to legal paperwork I would have received?\n",
    "- What is meant by “and be without counsel”?\n",
    "- I know this is pedantic, but under the criminal path the “adult” answer wasn’t capitalized but “Juvenile” was. Just a heads up.\n",
    "- I’m not sure what the purpose is for the “Are you sure?” follow-up question for income.\n",
    "- Might consider adding some more explanation on waiving the right to counsel, or a third “not sure” option similar to your income question. Someone in dire enough straights to need a court-appointed lawyer might not know whether they’ve mistakenly waived that right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I reached out to a lawyer in Virginia for feedback. Here was his feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lawyer Feedback:\n",
    "- Do you really need to enter someone's name? If so, doesn't it make sense to also get at least one piece of contact information - presumably this way you can reach them, or have that data for other purposes (e.g., ads, etc.)?  If this is a strict calculator to see if fee waiver applies, then you could just leave it out entirely.  \n",
    "- I entered \"Tom Brady\" and said I made $14000/wk.  I'm pretty sure this should not qualify for fee waiver.  Not sure if site is intended to be accurate or not.  If so, check the backend numbers to make sure those are correct.\n",
    "- I also don't like the \"Save Above Text As Answer\" - you should just be able to enter and click \"Next\"\n",
    "- I would also add rewrite the blurb under Virginia Indigency Calculator to say more affirmative what this site does. It looks like two things.  Determine if you waived right to counsel and whether can get fee waiver.  It may be better to do one, and then do the other. Rather than lump both together.  And if you ask whether someone waived their right - it seems that they are here to figure that out so asking them if they did or not may not be the best solution.\n",
    "- Do regular people know what Miranda rights are?  Maybe have link.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the concepts are good.  Needs more fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I collected feedback anonymously. I used Google Forms and received these [results](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/feedback.xlsx) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research and Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine this, I did research into the relevant laws in Virginia. The two codes are § 17.1-606 and § 19.2-159. \n",
    "\n",
    "§ 17.1-606 defines the fee waiver process in civil cases. \n",
    "Any person who is (i) a plaintiff in a civil action in a court of the Commonwealth and a resident of\n",
    "the Commonwealth or (ii) a defendant in a civil action in a court of the Commonwealth, and who\n",
    "is on account of his poverty unable to pay fees or costs, may be allowed by a court to sue or\n",
    "defend a suit therein, without paying fees or costs; whereupon he shall have, from any counsel\n",
    "whom the court may assign him, and from all officers, all needful services and process, without\n",
    "any fees, except what may be included in the costs recovered from the opposite party. In\n",
    "determining a person's inability to pay fees or costs on account of his poverty, the court shall\n",
    "consider the factors set forth in subsection B of § 19.2-159.\n",
    "\n",
    "§ 19.2-159 defines the appointment of counsel in criminal cases. \n",
    "It states that:\n",
    "A. If the accused shall claim that he is indigent, and the charge against him is a criminal offense\n",
    "which may be punishable by death or confinement in the state correctional facility or jail, subject\n",
    "to the provisions of § 19.2-160, the court shall determine from oral examination of the accused or\n",
    "other competent evidence whether or not the accused is indigent within the contemplation of\n",
    "law pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this section.\n",
    "B. In making its finding, the court shall determine whether or not the accused is a current\n",
    "recipient of a state or federally funded public assistance program for the indigent. If the accused\n",
    "is a current recipient of such a program and does not waive his right to counsel or retain counsel\n",
    "on his own behalf, he shall be presumed eligible for the appointment of counsel. This\n",
    "presumption shall be rebuttable where the court finds that a more thorough examination of the\n",
    "financial resources of the defendant is necessary. If the accused shall claim to be indigent and is\n",
    "not presumptively eligible under the provisions of this section, then a thorough examination of\n",
    "the financial resources of the accused shall be made with consideration given to the following:\n",
    "1. The net income of the accused, which shall include his total salary and wages minus\n",
    "deductions required by law. The court also shall take into account income and amenities from\n",
    "other sources including but not limited to social security funds, union funds, veteran's benefits,\n",
    "other regular support from an absent family member, public or private employee pensions,\n",
    "dividends, interests, rents, estates, trusts, or gifts.\n",
    "2. All assets of the accused which are convertible into cash within a reasonable period of time\n",
    "without causing substantial hardship or jeopardizing the ability of the accused to maintain home\n",
    "and employment. Assets shall include all cash on hand as well as in checking and savings\n",
    "accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and tax refunds. All personal property owned by\n",
    "the accused which is readily convertible into cash shall be considered, except property exempt\n",
    "from attachment. Any real estate owned by the accused shall be considered in terms of the\n",
    "amounts which could be raised by a loan on the property. For purposes of eligibility\n",
    "determination, the income, assets, and expenses of the spouse, if any, who is a member of the\n",
    "accused's household, shall be considered, unless the spouse was the victim of the offense or\n",
    "offenses allegedly committed by the accused.\n",
    "3. Any exceptional expenses of the accused and his family which would, in all probability,\n",
    "prohibit him from being able to secure private counsel. Such items shall include but not be\n",
    "limited to costs for medical care, family support obligations, and child care payments.\n",
    "The available funds of the accused shall be calculated as the sum of his total income and assets\n",
    "less the exceptional expenses as provided in paragraph 3 above. If the accused does not waive his\n",
    "right to counsel or retain counsel on his own behalf, counsel shall be appointed for the accused if\n",
    "his available funds are equal to or below 125 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines\n",
    "prescribed for the size of the household of the accused by the federal Department of Health and\n",
    "Human Services. The Supreme Court of Virginia shall be responsible for distributing to all courts\n",
    "the annual updates of the federal poverty income guidelines made by the Department.\n",
    "If the available funds of the accused exceed 125 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines\n",
    "and the accused fails to employ counsel and does not waive his right to counsel, the court may, in\n",
    "exceptional circumstances, and where the ends of justice so require, appoint an attorney to\n",
    "represent the accused. However, in making such appointments, the court shall state in writing its\n",
    "reasons for so doing. The written statement by the court shall be included in the permanent\n",
    "record of the case.\n",

    "## Real-World Viability\n",
    "\n",
    "I am continuing to work on adapting based on feedback. To make it more viable, I would have a more robust set of values to be filled. Currently it only has a small list of values that are recorded, and to make it more viable, it would provide the option"
