    "# Final Project: Homeline Tenant Assistance\n",
    "by Loren Chen and Michael McKeon\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we designed a chatbot for our partner Homeline that would provide assistants to Minnesota tenants with these [forms](https://homelinemn.org/form-letters/) by guiding them through the questions and pre-filling the answers. As a collaborative project, I was responsible for the intro pitch, initial outreach to the partner, the coding portion for the initial prototype, and the implementation of five of the remaining ten forms.\n",

    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framing\n",
    "Tenants in apartments tend to have a huge variety of problems, and they often don't have a streamlined way to approach their landlords. Homeline has created a library of forms for those users to implement. The issue is that many people don't have time to sit down and print out a form to fill out and would rather have a version on their phone or laptop for on the go. The project aimed to address the needs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research\n",
    "The first sort of system that came to mind was [QnA](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). This was one that we used in class and have some experience in. Other systems for this project that came up as possibilities were Google Forms or a more coded system, but with the already built-in functionality of QnA and our familiarity of using it in a legal aid context, this was the most reasonable choice. We also discussed our proposed plan with our partner and they thought that this sort of system would work well as well.\n",

    "### Prototyping\n",
    "The biggest thing that was of concern was the ability\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Testing\n",
    "We had two primary ways of user testing: testing by partner and individual testing. The feedback we received from our partner have been through email communication. Some of the user testing was in-person with friends and family, while most were done using Google Forms. The main issues that were brought up by the partner after the initial prototype were the lack of examples given to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Refinement\n",
    "We used this data obtained from user testing to refine the product. For the feedback from There was a selective \n",

    "There is a lot of documentation in the QnA itself as well as in my project folder. Michael and I split up the work\n",
    "### Real World Viability\n",
    "The viability of this was highlighted in the partner letter that was CC'd to you. This more automated process saves costs for both sides, the tenant and the advocate. ...\n",
