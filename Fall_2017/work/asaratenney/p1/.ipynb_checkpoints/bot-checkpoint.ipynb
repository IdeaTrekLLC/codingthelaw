The focus of this project is using simple technology to offer indigent clients information and accessible legal services. \n",

This simple system uses a series of questions to assess whether the user qualifies for a fee waiver or a public defender within their jurisdiction.  The user will also be able to generate customized form that will automatically input their individualized information straight into to applicable court forms.  The system will automate forms such as:\n",
