In a standard negligence case, the elements of the tort are duty, breach, causation, and damages. The duty is a duty of due care to act as a reasonable and prudent person so as to prevent a foreseeable injury to foreseeable persons and property.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2370\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"Boston medical Malpractice \" width=\"300\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-125x120.jpg 125w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>In the case of medical malpractice, we use the same standard, but instead of the reasonable and prudent person, we use a reasonable and prudent medical professional performing that same procedure. For example, in the case of heart surgeon preforming an operation, a surgeon is supposed to act as reasonable and prudent heart surgeon would act in performing the same procedure.<span id=\"more-2708\"></span>As our Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">medical malpractice</a> lawyers can explain, there was originally much disagreement over whether we used a local or national standard for that duty of due care for medical professionals.\\xc2\\xa0 Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say we have a case where person in a small town in South Dakota needed a medical procedure 50 years ago, and the town doctor was the only medical professional available. While he is very competent as a physician, he may not have the same equipment and experience as someone who worked in a major city like Boston or New York would have.\\xc2\\xa0 There was a time not too long ago when pregnant women who need to schedule a cesarean section (C Section) would need to go to a larger hospital in the city because their local hospital was not equipped to do the procedure unless it was an emergency and they had no choice.</p>\\n<p>There were some cases that argued that it should be local standard of care in medical malpractice cases, meaning that the small town doctor would not have to be held to the same standard of care as the doctor in a major city hospital. There were others who argued that the doctors should all be trained up to a national standard and should not be given a lower standard of care simply because they were practicing in a small town.</p>\\n<p>However, in a large city such as Boston, this is not generally the case.\\xc2\\xa0 We have some of the finest hospitals in the world that are affiliated with some of the finest medical schools in the world, so whether their doctors are held to a national or local standard of care, there will not be any breaks for the doctor merely because they work in Boston.\\xc2\\xa0 In fact, the exact opposite might be the result and a jury would hold them to a relatively higher standard of care.</p>\\n<p>In addition to negligence as a cause of action in medical malpractice cases, there is also the concept of medical battery.\\xc2\\xa0 The crux of this cause of action deals with the issue of informed consent.\\xc2\\xa0 When you have a medical procedure such as surgery, you are required to give your informed consent. This means you are told about all the benefits and risks and still decide to have the medical procedure.\\xc2\\xa0 Before you have surgery, you must give your informed consent.\\xc2\\xa0 Informed consent is a defense to the tort of battery, and battery is an intentional tort.</p>\\n<p>First let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s define the tort of battery.\\xc2\\xa0 Battery is defined as the harmful or offensive non-permissive touching of another.\\xc2\\xa0 If you are walking down the street and someone punches you in the face, that is not only a crime of assault and battery, but it is also the tort of battery, or assault and battery, depending on the circumstances.\\xc2\\xa0 That was a harmful or offensive touching for which you did not give your consent.\\xc2\\xa0 If you were in a boxing match for example, you would have implicitly or explicitly given your consent to enter into the fight and be punched in the fact. You could not file a lawsuit for battery for being punched in a sanctioned boxing match.\\xc2\\xa0 However, if the defendant exceeds the scope of the consent, you could have a tort case.</p>\\n<p>For example, if the boxer put a weight in his or her glove and hit you with that, you would not have consent to the illegal move and consent would not be a defense.\\xc2\\xa0 At the same time, when you go to the doctor to have knee surgery on your left knee, you are giving consent to have the doctor take a knife (scalpel) and cut into our knee.\\xc2\\xa0 If someone on the street cut you in the knee this would be assault, but not for a doctor with an informed consent signed. However, if the doctor accidentally performed the operation on your right knee, that could be medical malpractice and a medical battery, because you never gave consent to have the surgery performed on that leg.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 You may recall the series of cases that made big news in the 1990s when doctors allegedly amputated the wrong leg of several patients leaving them with no legs instead of the one good leg they were supposed to have. These cases were filed under a theory of negligence and medical battery.</p>\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://injurylawopinions.justia.com/2017/07/27/allison-v-brown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Allison v. Brown</em></a>, a case from the Supreme Court of Virginia, plaintiff filed medical malpractice case and argued that there was medical malpractice and medical battery. The trial court granted the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to set aside the verdict in favor of the plaintiff. While there is typically a desire to honor the jury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verdict, but there can be a motion filed that essentially says that a reasonable jury should not have been able to make such a decision based upon the evidence that was submitted in the case. This does not happen all that often but it was what happened here.</p>\\n<p>The reason for this motion being granted was the jury apparently relied upon a theory of medical battery, but that medical battery claim was not argued during trial. On appeal, the court of appeals agreed with this determination but also found that to set aside the entire verdict was not proper. For this reason, the case was remanded for a new trial.\\xc2\\xa0 In many cases such as this, the defendant will be more likely to settle, since they know how a jury will find and the plaintiff might be able to introduce evidence of medical battery at the second trial.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Health care providers frequently found liable for medical malpractice are those who assist women in childbirth. In fact, one <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/malpractice-report-2015/obgyn#page=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medscape survey</a> in 2015 noted that 85 percent of OB/GYN physicians will be sued for medical malpractice at some point in their careers.</p>\\n<p>That same survey indicated the most common reasons OB/GYNs are sued are because of:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Patient suffering abnormal injury;</li>\\n<li>Failure to diagnose;</li>\\n<li>Failure to treat;</li>\\n<li>Poor documentation of patient instruction/ education;</li>\\n<li>Improperly obtaining/ lack of informed consent;</li>\\n<li>Failure to follow safety procedures;</li>\\n<li>Medication errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These mistakes can occur during pregnancy, or at some point during labor or in the course of delivery. The impact of a medical mistake on the mother and child can be devastating and lifelong. However, the amount of time you have to file a claim is not infinite. The statute of limitations limits the amount of time you have to assert a claim.</p>\\n<p><span id=\"more-2694\"></span></p>\\n<p>When you go to the hospital after going into labor, you are transferred to a birthing suite and assigned a nurse and various nursing assistants. These medical professionals monitor your vital signs, start IVs and administer medication pursuant to orders from an obstetrician.\\xc2\\xa0 You are relying on every one of these individuals to do their jobs\\xc2\\xa0according to the applicable standard of care. If something goes wrong, or the doctor otherwise decides you need to have a cesarean section (C-section), you will be taken into an operating room on the labor and delivery ward.\\xc2\\xa0 Prior to having surgery, an anesthesiologist will insert a spinal block of some kind.\\xc2\\xa0 He or she may or may not use a fluoroscope.\\xc2\\xa0 There will be various people in the emergency room, including one who will be responsible for counting every tool, sponge, and piece of gauze used to make sure one is not left in the patient.</p>\\n<p>As our Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">medical malpractice</a>\\xc2\\xa0attorneys\\xc2\\xa0can explain, if an instrument of any other material from the hospital is left inside a patient, this is known as a foreign objects medical malpractice case.</p>\\n<p><strong>Foreign Objects Medical Malpractice Statute of Limitations</strong></p>\\n<p>Pursuant to <a href=\"https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleV/Chapter260/Section4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Section 4 of Chapter 260</a> of the Massachusetts General Laws (MGL), the statute of limitations is three years in most cases.\\xc2\\xa0 This means that a civil personal injury medical malpractice lawsuit must be filed within three years from the date the cause of action accrued.\\xc2\\xa0 This means the day when the medical procedure was performed.</p>\\n<p>However, in some cases, it is not possible for a patient to know that the injury has occurred until sometime after the date the medical procedure was performed.\\xc2\\xa0 In these cases, there can be a case filed in no more than seven years from date the injury occurred. However, there is one additional statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this involves the foreign objects medical malpractice case.</p>\\n<p>There has been a lot of change in this area of medical malpractice law in Massachusetts over the past several decades.\\xc2\\xa0 One of the initial landmark legal decisions (that has since be overturned, but for reasons the exception to the statute of limitations created was too narrow), is <a href=\"http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/350/350mass450.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Pasquale v. Chandler</em></a> (1966).\\xc2\\xa0 In this case, a patient went to his doctor in the 1950s complaining of stomach pain and weight loss. He was told that he would need to have surgery and a radical removal of most of the stomach was performed.\\xc2\\xa0 During this procedure, his surgeon used more than 50 Kelly clamps.\\xc2\\xa0 A Kelly clamp looks like a pair of scissors and is very similar to a hemostat.\\xc2\\xa0 The Kelly clamp has interlocking teeth at curved tip a ratchet locking mechanism to clamp it shut on tissue or large blood vessels.</p>\\n<p>In this case, the surgery was performed and the clip was left inside the patient. He complained about heart burn years later and they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figure out what was wrong until they took an x-ray. This was before the days of MRIs and computer assisted imaging so all they could see was a foreign object.\\xc2\\xa0 When they performed surgery to remove it, they found a rusted Kelly clamp that had become lodged in his intestines.\\xc2\\xa0 He did slightly better immediately following the surgery but died soon after.</p>\\n<p>The Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), which is our state supreme court, decided that there could be an exception to the then three-year statute of limitations on medical malpractice cases, but only in foreign objects cases.</p>\\n<p>This case was later overturned in a case entitled <em>Franklin v. Albert</em> (1980). In this case, the court decided that the earlier court (still the SJC) had been too focused on the legislative history of the statute and less on due process clause the reasonableness of the conclusion.\\xc2\\xa0 The court determined that the plaintiff should have a reasonable time to discover that he or she was injured.\\xc2\\xa0 This however, was further changed when the legislature added the exception that there is no time limit for cases involving foreign objects.</p>\\n<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Tribunals in Boston Personal Injury Cases</strong></p>\\n<p>One other thing that makes medical malpractice cases somewhat different than other personal injury cases, as we have discussed in our Resources for Injured Patients section entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9c<a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/do-i-have-a-medical-malpractice-case.html\"><em>Do I Have a Medical Malpractice Case?</em></a>\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the use of medical malpractice tribunals.</p>\\n<p>As we discussed in that resource page, <a href=\"https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter231/Section60B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Massachusetts G.L. c. 231 Section 60B</a>, establishes the requirement for a tribunal for malpractice cases against healthcare providers.\\xc2\\xa0 We use the term medical malpractice, and many people think of doctors, but we can also be talking about various other healthcare providers.</p>\\n<p>Prior to filing a case in the Suffolk Superior Court, which is the court of general jurisdiction for civil personal injury claims in Boston, the case must go before a medical malpractice tribunal.\\xc2\\xa0 This panel is meant to serve as a gatekeeper to keep frivolous claims out of court in an attempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums for medical providers.</p>\\n<p>The panel is to consist of one judge from the superior court, a doctor licensed to practice medicine in Massachusetts, as well as an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth. At this hearing, the plaintiff, through his or her attorney, is required to present a proffer also known as an order of proof to determine if the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would be enough to raise a legitimate question of liability.\\xc2\\xa0 While this is generally not considered a very high standard, it is essential to ask your attorney if he or she has had experience going before these medical malpractice tribunals in Boston and had successful results in the past.</p>\\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that if you do not make it past a medical malpractice tribunal, you do not have a valid medical malpractice claim. On the other hand, just because you are successful at a tribunal does not mean you will win your case.\\xc2\\xa0 You still want an experienced medical malpractice attorney in Boston fighting for your right to a full and appropriate financial recovery.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

In cases where a plaintiff had a 50 percent or greater chance of survival/ better outcome prior to the alleged wrongful act, courts will usually apply the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; standard. That requires\\xc2\\xa0plaintiff to prove it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; he or she\\xc2\\xa0would have had a better outcome were it not for defendant&#8217;s actions. The reason is under traditional concepts of causation, a plaintiff with less than 50 percent chance of a positive outcome wouldn&#8217;t have grounds for a claim. The loss of chance doctrine gives them a platform.<span id=\"more-2578\"></span></p>\\n<p>A <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/2017/91374-9.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent case</a> out of Washington state dealt with this issue.</p>\\n<p>In that case, plaintiff visited his primary care provider in 2011 for a lesion that had developed on his left foot after he suffered a puncture wound. His primary care doctor referred him to a podiatrist, who saw him the same day and diagnosed him as having a non-cancerous lesion. Podiatrist recommended two possible courses of treatment: The first surgery or the second cryotherapy. Plaintiff chose the more conservative treatment, which was administered that day. Plaintiff was instructed to return in 10 days.</p>\\n<p>When plaintiff returned, the lesion still had not gone away. The doctor this time recommended surgery, but also gave plaintiff the option of a more conservative course of treatment, and plaintiff chose the latter. That treatment was administered and instructions were given for plaintiff to return in 10 days. However, plaintiff did not come back as scheduled. Then two months later, plaintiff contacted the doctor to complain of soreness and asked for an MRI. The following day, the podiatrist saw that the lesion had gotten bigger and recommended a biopsy, though he did not suspect cancer.</p>\\n<p>Plaintiff sought a second opinion, and that doctor also diagnosed the legion as benign. That doctor too recommended surgery, but plaintiff chose the more alternative treatment.</p>\\n<p>The next month, a dermatologist performed a biopsy and found the results positive for melanoma. Plaintiff underwent surgery and the cancer was removed, but it recurred. After unsuccessful chemotherapy and radiation, plaintiff&#8217;s left foot had to be removed.</p>\\n<p>Plaintiff filed a <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">medical malpractice</a> lawsuit against\\xc2\\xa0the employer of the original podiatrist, alleging he was deprived of a 40 percent chance the cancer would not recur had a proper diagnosis and treatment been rendered at the time. Defendant argued plaintiff had been contributorily negligent in delaying follow-up care and seeking a second opinion.</p>\\n<p>Trial court granted plaintiff&#8217;s motion to instruct the jury on the loss of chance doctrine, and found that a but-for causation standard was appropriate (rather than the substantial factor test, which is less stringent). The court also granted a partial summary judgment disallowing defendant from arguing contributory negligence in this action.</p>\\n<p>In its review, the state supreme court ruled that the but-for cause analysis was the appropriate standard moving forward, and the defendant should be allowed to present evidence of contributory negligence. The case was remanded to trial for further proceedings.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

A normal verdict form is simply one that asks if the defendant is liable or not, and if the defendant is liable, then the jury is expected to also decide the amount of damages (financial compensation) that should be awarded to the plaintiff.\\xc2\\xa0 If there is no finding of negligence, then there is obviously not a need to return an award of damages.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2370 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-300x287.jpg\" alt=\"tool\" width=\"300\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-300x287.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540-125x120.jpg 125w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/09/reflex-hammer-1421540.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>However, there can also be special verdict forms that ask jurors to separately decide on different elements of a tort ,such as negligence, because in some cases, additional elements must be established for certain penalties and monetary awards to be triggered.\\xc2\\xa0 In this case, the jury returned a special verdict that found defendant was negligent in treating defendant, but that their negligent treatment was not responsible for him becoming a quadriplegic.\\xc2\\xa0 <span id=\"more-2525\"></span>Shortly following the verdict, plaintiff died, and an autopsy was preformed.\\xc2\\xa0 At this autopsy, additional evidence was discovered that plaintiff alleged was proof the jury could have used to find the negligence did cause the quadriplegia.\\xc2\\xa0 At that point, plaintiff, now his estate being administered by his surviving spouse, moved for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. However, it was determined that plaintiff did not pay a filing fee in a timely manner, and since the defendant did not object to the failure to timely pay the fee, a new trial was ordered.</p>\\n<p>At this point, the defendant argued on appeal that the new trial should not have been granted, because the fee was not paid on time.\\xc2\\xa0 As our\\xc2\\xa0Boston\\xc2\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/personal-injury.html\">personal injury </a>attorneys can explain, medical malpractice cases in particular can be very complex, and the best thing you can do during your initial consultation is to make sure your attorney has a considerable amount of experience representing plaintiffs in these types of cases.</p>\\n<p>The court of appeals listened to the arguments from both sides and determined that the new trial was properly granted.\\xc2\\xa0 This has to do with a complex issue in appellate law pertaining to whether a litigant made a timely objection for the basis, and is therefore said to have preserved the issue for appeal.</p>\\n<p>The way appellate courts works is that they review the record of the prior hearings and listen to arguments and read papers.\\xc2\\xa0 This means the court of appeals will read the transcript to get the record of a case and look at exhibits that are preserved on the docket.\\xc2\\xa0 The court of appeals will not listen to new evidence for the most part. The reason behind this is that the courts feel that the trial judge is the best position to evaluate the evidence, since these lower courts get a like view of the evidence.\\xc2\\xa0 This translates to issues on appeal, because if the objection was not made at trial or at the proper time, it is not in the record, and, therefore, the record does not speak to that issue.\\xc2\\xa0 If the record doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak to something, it is not appealable in most cases.</p>\\n<p><em>If you are injured in Boston, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

After being examined, doctors referred the child to what they call the sarcoma group to have the lumped imaged and a biopsy taken.<span id=\"more-2369\"></span></p>\\n<p>The sarcoma group is made up of various cancer specialists who regularly treat patients with tumors. The team members meet with each other twice a week to discuss their cases so everyone was on the same page, according to court records.\\xc2\\xa0 The group made an initial diagnosis of the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lump as being a hamartoma.\\xc2\\xa0 A hamartoma is a benign tumor-like lump, but is not a malignant tumor.</p>\\n<p>However, when the child was 8 years old, the lump had increased in size, and it caused the child to develop a limp. One of the doctors on the sarcoma team performed another biopsy at this point.\\xc2\\xa0 The doctor now determined the lump was covering most of his calf.\\xc2\\xa0 This included both the muscle and nerves and was the reason for the limp.\\xc2\\xa0 This time, they determined that the lump was what is known as a desmoid tumor.\\xc2\\xa0 This is a very rare tumor that is also benign.</p>\\n<p>The reason these tumors are so dangerous is that, while they are not cancerous, they can destroy tissue that is otherwise healthy.\\xc2\\xa0 At this point, members of the cancer team decided to schedule an operation to remove the tumor.\\xc2\\xa0 However, the child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother decided to look into other options, including the use of Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA).\\xc2\\xa0 One of the members of the team said that he actually invented the RFA procedure.\\xc2\\xa0 The group decided that RFA procedure would be appropriate.\\xc2\\xa0 There were serious risks associated with this procedure, but his parents signed a consent.</p>\\n<p>During the procedure, things did not go exactly as planned, and more tissue was burned away than originally targeted.\\xc2\\xa0 The doctor called other doctors from the treatment team into the operating room, and they made a decision to stop doing the rest of the procedure. They told the parents that there were some problems, but that the child would heal okay following the procedure.\\xc2\\xa0 The child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother said she was not told how serious the problem was or that the child had been burned so badly.</p>\\n<p>Several weeks later, the child was in rehab, and the leg became necrotic and eventually had to be amputated. There were several more years of treatment, and eventually the parents filed a Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">medical malpractice lawsuit</a>.\\xc2\\xa0 It had been four years following the initial surgery. The defendants argued that the action was time barred because it was filed after the statute of limitations had run.\\xc2\\xa0 The court agreed and dismissed the cause of action.</p>\\n<p>At this point the parents appealed, arguing that since he was under continuing treatment, the statute of limitations had not run.\\xc2\\xa0 Initially, the court of appeals agreed, but the SJC ultimately held that the statute of limitations was not tolled in this case.</p>\\n<p><em>If you are injured in an accident in Boston, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Plaintiff was a patient of defendants.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/nurses.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2286\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/nurses-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"nurses\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/nurses-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/nurses-87x120.jpg 87w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/nurses.jpg 451w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px\" /></a>In April 2011, plaintiff went to defendants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 medical clinic to have a procedure performed.\\xc2\\xa0 One day prior to the two-year anniversary of this doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit, the plaintiff filed a medical malpractice lawsuit claiming that the defendants had provided care that fell below the acceptable standard of due care, and as a result of the breach of the duty of care, she was injured.<span id=\"more-2367\"></span>As your Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">medical malpractice</a> attorney can explain, a medical malpractice case is a negligence case like any other, except the defendants are typically held to the standard of a care of a professional in the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specialty or area of practice. In other words, in a normal negligence case, the defendant is held to the standard of acting as a reasonable and prudent person so as to avoid foreseeable injury to foreseeable persons and property.\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0However, in a medical malpractice case, the defendant is held to the standard of conducting himself or herself as a reasonable and prudent medical provider in the particular specialty anywhere else in the nation.\\xc2\\xa0 For example, if the defendant is a cardiologist, he or she must act as a reasonable cardiologist that is performing a procedure on a patient anywhere else in the country.</p>\\n<p>In this case, plaintiff alleged that the cause of her injuries was a result of of medical professionals who treated her using latex gloves when they had been told she had a latex allergy.\\xc2\\xa0 If a patient is allergic to latex, doctors and nurses will typically use a vinyl, nitrile, or polyurethane glove, since they do not contain natural latex. Latex allergies can be quite severe and can cause a patient to go into anaphylactic shock, so this is a big deal.\\xc2\\xa0 To avoid this risk, many healthcare providers now use non-latex gloves as standard practice. Plaintiff alleged that defendants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 failing to provide her with a latex free environment during treatment caused her to suffer an allergic reaction that resulted in severe personal injury.</p>\\n<p>In this case, plaintiff hired an attorney who was not licensed in the jurisdiction, but that attorney associated with local counsel and appeared on what is known as a <em>pro hac vice </em>basis.\\xc2\\xa0 This is typically allowed and actually happens all the time.</p>\\n<p>The problem was, as the defendants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argued, the <em>pro hac </em>motion had not been filed along with the complaint, as is normally required, so the attorney technically did not have a right to file the motion.\\xc2\\xa0 They also argued that the case should be dismissed, since this would mean that the complaint was not timely filed within the two-year statute of limitations.\\xc2\\xa0 The trial court did not agree and found that the action had been properly filed for the purposes of the statute of limitations and allowed the case to proceed.</p>\\n<p>Later, the state supreme court found issues with the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling based upon a statute relevant in that jurisdiction and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Her baby boy wasn&#8217;t moving as he had in the days and hours before. But when she got there, student resident doctors at The University\\xc2\\xa0of Chicago Medical Center didn&#8217;t take immediate action, even when a fetal heart monitor immediately showed distress. For 12 hours, no action was taken. For 12 hours, that child was slowly suffocating.\\xc2\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"pregnantwoman\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-180x120.jpg 180w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\\n<p>When doctors finally did initiate an emergency Cesarean section, the baby boy wasn&#8217;t breathing. He was revived and then rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit and placed on life support. There, he stayed for weeks. But the damage to his brain over the course of those hours was irreversible. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He can&#8217;t walk. He can&#8217;t bathe himself. He can&#8217;t feed himself. He requires around-the-clock care, provided almost exclusively by his single mother.</p>\\n<p>Now, a jury in Cook County, Ill. has awarded $53 million to him and his mother, which will not only ensure his health care is covered for the next 65 years of his life, but will help to compensate the family for the pain and suffering they have endured and will endure for the rest of their lives. Some will look at a damage award of this size and characterize it as excessive. But one must consider that not only will his future medical bills top $30 million over the course of his life, but mother and son will never have a normal relationship. This boy will never have a normal life of his own.\\xc2\\xa0<span id=\"more-2261\"></span></p>\\n<p>These life-altering consequences were avoidable. Had the doctors and hospital offered an appropriate standard of care, this story might have turned out very differently.</p>\\n<p>Soon after the boy&#8217;s birth, doctors diagnosed him with hypoxia, which is injury caused by lack of oxygen to the brain. However, they never told his mother what caused the hypoxia or who might be responsible. Later, after she filed a lawsuit, the defense contended the mother and baby were treated for an infection, and that infection is a known cause of cerebral palsy in newborns.</p>\\n<p>Plaintiff&#8217;s attorney discounted that theory. Every doctor who has seen him in 12 years has diagnosed him with the same thing: The <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/birth-injuries.html\">birth injury </a>of asphyxia, meaning that he was suffocated at birth. For the defense to come forward years later and claim there was an infection &#8211; about which the mother didn&#8217;t know and there are no clear records &#8211; is preposterous.</p>\\n<p>Following four hours of deliberation, jurors awarded the boy $2.7 million for disfigurement, $2.7 million for loss of a normal life, $2.7 million for a life expectancy shortened, $2.7 million for past and future pain and suffering, $2.7 million for emotional distress and more for past medical expenses, future medical expenses and future caretaking expenses. Loss of future earning capacity is also factored into the damage award.</p>\\n<p>As the plaintiff&#8217;s lawyers explained, this is by no means a windfall. This was about holding the hospital accountable and also ensuring this boy and his mother have the financial means to cope with the lifelong damage inflicted on them by no fault of their own.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

And just because someone suffers a poor health outcome doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean medical malpractice is to blame. However, these &#8220;never events&#8221; are so egregious for the fact that they are deemed entirely preventable. We know what causes them. We know how to stop them. And hospitals should have procedures and policies in place that are strictly followed by staffers to ensure these kinds of things never happen.<span id=\"more-2240\"></span></p>\\n<p>And still, they do.</p>\\n<p>You may recall six years ago the high-profile <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/medical-malpractice_2.html\">Boston medical malpractice </a>case involving a Massachusetts General Hospital hand and arm surgeon who went public with details about how he incorrectly operated on the incorrect hand of a 65-year-old woman. Such forthrightness isn&#8217;t common. In fact, he issued a seven-page apology to his patient &#8211; which is essentially another kind of &#8220;never event.&#8221; Physicians with the medical industry standard setting organization National Quality Forum praised the doctor&#8217;s willingness to come forward.</p>\\n<p>A landmark study in 1999 by the Institute of Medicine titled, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/1999/To-Err-is-Human/To%20Err%20is%20Human%201999%20%20report%20brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">To Err is Human</a>,&#8221; opined that between 44,000 and 98,000 people die in hospitals across the country every year in &#8220;never event&#8221; medical errors, costing between $17 billion and $29 billion. Subsequent research suggests the latest figures may be double that, despite the fact that we have an even better understanding and greater awareness today of these kind of events.</p>\\n<p>The Castlight-Leapfrog researchers asserted that when hospitals take a proactive approach to managing these types of events, they are far less likely to occur and may even be eliminated.</p>\\n<p>The good news is that the agency reported 80 percent of hospitals do have strict protocol in place for how to respond when a &#8220;never event&#8221; does occur. Those require that hospitals:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Apologize;</li>\\n<li>Report error to an outside agency;</li>\\n<li>Perform a root-cause analysis;</li>\\n<li>Waive related costs;</li>\\n<li>Make the policy available.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Massachusetts in particular has a good reputation for this, with 90 percent or more hospitals meeting the industry standards for &#8220;never event&#8221; policies as of 2015. Nationally, there has been a significant increase in the number of hospitals meeting this standard. It jumped from 53 percent in 1992 to 79 percent in 2012.</p>\\n<p>Still, sometimes even when a facility has that policy in place, it&#8217;s not always followed. Too often, the first concern is shielding the agency from liability from medical malpractice litigation. The concern is that an apology is an admission of liability, which is why many doctors and facilities refrain.</p>\\n<p><em>If you have suffered personal injury in Massachusetts, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

There were also special damages alleged as part of plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action.<span id=\"more-2042\"></span></p>\\n<p>Defendant filed an affirmative defense as part of its answer. An affirmative defense generally involves a theory that even if everything plaintiff has alleged is true, the defendant would be not be labile for any damages. At this point, the parties agreed to a scheduling order with all dates listed until the date of trial. A scheduling order will include dates for the close of discovery, dates when expert witness information must be exchanged, and dates of other important things that occur during the pretrial phase of any litigation.</p>\\n<p>In this case, experts were to be designated on November 30, 2013. However, the plaintiff failed to designate an expert by the appropriate date. In medical malpractice cases, expert witnesses are generally necessary, because a jury is not generally able to understand if a hospital or doctor breached the applicable standard of care for patients presenting with the same or similar symptoms without expert testimony.</p>\\n<p>At this point, plaintiff filed a motion for a continuance and asked for more time before trial and the ability to file an expert notice after the deadline. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the same day, asking that the case be dismissed on grounds that plaintiff cannot prove their case as a matter of law, because they had not designated an exert witness. After receiving the motion to continue, defendants filed an opposition to this motion. The defendant claimed they were harmed by the three-month delay in not receiving expert notice from plaintiff, and the motion should be denied. This would mean that the case would be dismissed. The court denied defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to continue the trial and late file discovery, including expert witness information.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 Plaintiff filed an interlocutory appeal, asking the trial judge be deemed to have erred as a matter of law in granting the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to continue.</p>\\n<p>An interlocutory appeal is an appeal that is made before a final judgment is rendered in the case. Typically, litigants must wait until the matter is concluded, but there are certain issues than be raised as an interlocutory appeal. This is a complicated issue, and your Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/personal-injury.html\">personal injury</a> attorney can discuss how this would apply in your particular case should the need arise.</p>\\n<p>In this case, when defendants appealed, the court reviewed the record from the case and determined that trial court did not err as a matter of law and affirmed trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original ruling. This allowed the case to proceed to trial with the judge allowing plaintiff to introduce an expert witness notice.</p>\\n<p><em>If you are injured in an accident in Boston, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Roitmanm</em></a> involved a heavily contested divorce proceeding. As part of his case, husband hired a psychiatrist as an expert to provide a psychiatric analysis of his wife. Even though the doctor had never personally examined or even met plaintiff, the doctor submitted a written report to the judge in which plaintiff was diagnosed with a personality disorder and noted she had serious mental health issues and was not likely to improve.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2015/06/stethascope1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-588\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-588\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2015/06/stethascope1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"stethascope1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2015/06/stethascope1.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2015/06/stethascope1-160x120.jpg 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>Following this report, plaintiff filed a lawsuit against doctor in which she alleged that doctor committed medical malpractice by making such a negative diagnosis without ever having met plaintiff. She claimed this diagnosis caused her to suffer emotional distress. In this case, it was both negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as one claim of civil conspiracy. She claimed that making such a diagnosis without have personally conducted any sort of examination or even reviewing other doctors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 records was a breach of the applicable standard of care for a medical health professional in the psychiatric field.<span id=\"more-2044\"></span></p>\\n<p>In response to plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s filing of a cause of action, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that a doctor testifying as an expert witness has immunity from causes of action based upon their testimony. This concept of immunity comes from a desire to have witnesses not be afraid to testify at trial. However, we are normally dealing with the issue of defamation and not an intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress. The trial court found that defendant did have an absolute privilege of immunity in this matter and dismissed the case against her. At this point, plaintiff appealed the dismissal on grounds that her privilege only applied to defamation claims, which she had not filed in this case.</p>\\n<p>In this type of appeal, the court looked at the facts in the light most favorable to the not moving party. This means that court will accept all of plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s facts as true for the purpose of the appeal. The only way an appeal can succeed is in the case where, even if everything plaintiff says is true, she would still not have a case in which a jury could reasonably find for the defendant.</p>\\n<p>The court then looked at the issue of whether an absolute immunity defense applied to claims of intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress instead of simply defamation claims as the privilege was originally intended. The court concluded that state law limited absolute immunity for a testifying witness to claims of defamation and not the intentional infliction of emotional distress or the negligent infliction of emotional distress. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\n<p>It should be noted that negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claims are hard to prove, and just because the court reversed the trial judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal, it does not mean that she automatically wins the case. It means that she will be able to proceed with the case and eventually a jury can determine if defendant is liable to plaintiff for intentional infliction of emotional distress or negligent infliction of emotional distress, or not at all. Emotional distress claims can be very complicated, and you should speak with an experienced Boston <a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/personal-injury.html\">personal injury</a> lawyer about the facts of your particular cause of action.</p>\\n<p><em>If you are injured in Boston, call the Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Health care providers frequently found liable for medical malpractice are those who assist women in childbirth. In fact, one <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/malpractice-report-2015/obgyn#page=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medscape survey</a> in 2015 noted that 85 percent of OB/GYN physicians will be sued for medical malpractice at some point in their careers.</p>\\n<p>That same survey indicated the most common reasons OB/GYNs are sued are because of:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Patient suffering abnormal injury;</li>\\n<li>Failure to diagnose;</li>\\n<li>Failure to treat;</li>\\n<li>Poor documentation of patient instruction/ education;</li>\\n<li>Improperly obtaining/ lack of informed consent;</li>\\n<li>Failure to follow safety procedures;</li>\\n<li>Medication errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These mistakes can occur during pregnancy, or at some point during labor or in the course of delivery. The impact of a medical mistake on the mother and child can be devastating and lifelong. However, the amount of time you have to file a claim is not infinite.

In cases where a plaintiff had a 50 percent or greater chance of survival/ better outcome prior to the alleged wrongful act, courts will usually apply the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; standard. That requires\\xc2\\xa0plaintiff to prove it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; he or she\\xc2\\xa0would have had a better outcome were it not for defendant&#8217;s actions. The reason is under traditional concepts of causation, a plaintiff with less than 50 percent chance of a positive outcome wouldn&#8217;t have grounds for a claim. The loss of chance doctrine gives them a platform. <a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/2017/03/medical-malpractice-lost-chance-better-outcome.html#more-2578\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<footer>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"author vcard\">by <span itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\" itemscope><a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/\" class=\"url fn author-jeffreysglassman1 author-2175 post-author-link\" rel=\"author\" target=\"_self\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

Her baby boy wasn&#8217;t moving as he had in the days and hours before. But when she got there, student resident doctors at The University\\xc2\\xa0of Chicago Medical Center didn&#8217;t take immediate action, even when a fetal heart monitor immediately showed distress. For 12 hours, no action was taken. For 12 hours, that child was slowly suffocating.\\xc2\\xa0<a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"pregnantwoman\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman-180x120.jpg 180w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/07/pregnantwoman.jpg 425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\\n<p>When doctors finally did initiate an emergency Cesarean section, the baby boy wasn&#8217;t breathing. He was revived and then rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit and placed on life support. There, he stayed for weeks. But the damage to his brain over the course of those hours was irreversible. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He can&#8217;t walk. He can&#8217;t bathe himself. He can&#8217;t feed himself. He requires around-the-clock care, provided almost exclusively by his single mother.</p>\\n<p>Now, a jury in Cook County, Ill. has awarded $53 million to him and his mother, which will not only ensure his health care is covered for the next 65 years of his life, but will help to compensate the family for the pain and suffering they have endured and will endure for the rest of their lives. Some will look at a damage award of this size and characterize it as excessive. But one must consider that not only will his future medical bills top $30 million over the course of his life, but mother and son will never have a normal relationship. This boy will never have a normal life of his own.\\xc2\\xa0 <a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/2016/07/53m-verdict-birth-injury-victim-mother-medical-malpractice.html#more-2261\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading</a></p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<footer>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"author vcard\">by <span itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\" itemscope><a href=\"https://www.jeffreysglassman.com/\" class=\"url fn author-jeffreysglassman1 author-2175 post-author-link\" rel=\"author\" target=\"_self\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Law Offices of Jeffrey S.

It&#8217;s a reference to the types of medical errors that health professionals agree should <strong>never</strong> happen. And yet, they do. Some examples:<a href=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/06/doctor5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2242\" src=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/06/doctor5-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"doctor5\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/06/doctor5-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/06/doctor5-166x120.jpg 166w, https://www.bostonpersonalinjuryattorneyblog.com/files/2016/06/doctor5.jpg 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Retained surgical instruments (surgical tools, sponges, etc. being left inside a patient after a procedure);</li>\\n<li>Wrong surgery site (a surgeon performs surgery on the wrong limb, body part, person, etc.);</li>\\n<li>Urinary tract infection from a catheter;</li>\\n<li>Pressure ulcers (Stage III and IV);</li>\\n<li>Falls and trauma;</li>\\n<li>Surgical site infections;</li>\\n<li>Medication error fatalities;</li>\\n<li>Administration of incompatible blood;</li>\\n<li>Air embolisms.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Now, a recent study by <a href=\"http://www.leapfroggroup.org/sites/default/files/Files/Castlight-Leapfrog_Never_Events_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Castlight-Leapfrog</a>\\xc2\\xa0reveals not only are these events occurring, they are happening with alarming frequency.\\xc2\\xa0Although there is always some risk a patient incurs with every type of medical treatment. And just because someone suffers a poor health outcome doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean medical malpractice is to blame. However, these &#8220;never events&#8221; are so egregious for the fact that they are deemed entirely preventable. We know what causes them. We know how to stop them.
