    "## Where is this idea from?\n",
    "\n",
    "I began speaking to the attorney who works at [Asian Task Force Against Domestic Violence](https://www.atask.org/site/) (ATASK). I used to work at this nonprofit before law school and manages the legal program there. \n",
    "I interviewed the attorney and also the advocates who work mostly with immigrants on what they believe is the most time consuming thing they do in their job. After the meetings, the first issue identified is the database that collects all the client's information for grant purposes. The attorney keeps her own record and everytime during a meeting with a client, she would have to input all the basic information of the client and save it to her own spreadsheet. The current database we have is underfunded and there is no way to create a section for the legal program, therefore, she is inputting these information manually. This cost her a lot of time and effort and extended the amount of meeting time between the client and the attorney. Second, is the repetitive forms she has to fill out for immigration documents. \n",
    "For the advocates, the most tedious work they have to do all the time is filling out the financial statement. Not only is there no transalted version, advocates have to do the calculation by hand because most of the client's knowledge of their income and expense is per month, while the financial statement requires per week. The calculation is also not known to all because instead of dividing the number by 4, the court is asking to have the total divided by 4.3 when calculating per week from a monthly check or expenses.  I then thought it would be a good idea to also include naturalization forms as well since they are difficult to understand and takes up a lot of time to fill out from my past expereiences as an advocate.\n",
    "After gathering these information, I spoke to the Professor to find out a way to solve these problems. We then deceide that it would be a good idea to utilize google form for the questions and then use the information from the excel sheet created to do a mailmerge to fill out the financial statements. The attorney would then also have access to the client's information and eventually do a mailmerge for immigration documents. The process for filling out the naturalization would be the same as the financial statement. This project, we only focuses on obtaining basic client information that the attorney needs before meeting with her to cut down her time in record keeping, and also creating forms for clients to fill out so that advocates can use mailmerge to create a financial statement and naturalization form that could be submitted to court or USCIS. They can review those documents with the clients but do no have to sit with them and fill out the forms.\n",
    "I further researched to ensure that putting information on the cloud is within professional conduct. [Here](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/cloud-ethics-chart.html) is what the ABA suggests."

    "## Preparation\n",
    "In order to protect confidential material, certain information would not be found in this notebook. Instead it will be noted in a readme.txt file and will be send seperately to Professor.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I created a new google account.\n",
    "Then I begin creating three forms that I need for the project. The first is a client information questionere, the second is a financial statement, mostly use in probate in family court during divorce proceedings and the last is the naturalization form from USCIS.\n",
    "I first need to figure out what questions I would need for the forms. So i have to decipher the forms that I want as an end result and write out all the required questions for the google form.\n",
    "[Here](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/shentail/Final Project/questions.docx) is the first draft. I later one added more questions (questions regarding expenses and income for the financial statement) that would be incorporated into the current version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then i spoke to advocates again to ask for their opinions. After some discussion, they stated that the financial statement would work but after second thought, the naturalization forms might not be worth the time. Beacuse clients are mostly immigrants, they will have difficulty understanding the questions even if they are online and translated. They are also especially nervous when filling out these forms even though we are able to change the contents afterwards. The advocates believe that the forms will instead create more work for them because the clients will still go to them and ask for specificiation and explanations. Then they will have to meet with the attorney. This is also the same process they have been doing, so it would not lessen their work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I decided not to do the naturalization form. Another issue that came up is that those forms changes every seven to eight years and when you submit them, USCIS requires you to submit the newest version. For financial statements to the probate and family court, there is a less stricter rules on which version you submit. It will be difficult to maintain for future continuous usage if the naturalization forms update, since there are over 40 pages to fill out. "

    "## Codes\n",
    "Then I went to meet with Professor to work out the codes below. We used codes from both project 1 and project 2 because we are dealing with mailmerge and google sheets. With the codes, I was able to import the data from the 2 google forms I have created and have them download to a csv file. I imported 2 seperate documents, client information and financial statement. Then with a common identification code (Client ID), I combined the information on both forms into one csv file, creating combine.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we would need to export the files and codes to a exec file in order to download them onto the network computer at ATASK. After the exec file is created, no other forms could be added. Because we are working with immigrants, I am also creating transalted versions of the google form so that clients instead of advocates can fill out the form. The output of the financial statement will still be in English though. There will be multiple versions of mailmerge financial statement forms that would allow differnt excel sheets to import into. \n",
    "Therefore, I have to create extra google forms before changing the file into an exec file. The tweaking of the forms and financial statement could happen afterwards. Below are all the forms including those in other languages. (Chinese, Vietnamese, Hindi, Khmer) "
