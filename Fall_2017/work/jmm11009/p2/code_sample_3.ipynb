I\\'ve heard many comments about people never \\n\\t\\tseeing the lake so high.&nbsp; Apparently many have short memories. In \\n\\t\\t2006, the lake level came close to overtopping the dam, and there was \\n\\t\\textensive flooding. There were severe road washouts in the whole Lakes \\n\\t\\tRegion. Levels were also higher in 2007 and 2010. (see here for \\n\\t\\tWinnipesaukee lake level history\\n\\t\\t<a href=\"http://www.bizer.com/bztnews.htm#lakelevel\">\\n\\t\\thttp://www.bizer.com/bztnews.htm#lakelevel</a> . Also see\\n\\t\\t<a href=\"http://www.nws.noaa.gov/floodsafety/states/nh-flood.shtml\">\\n\\t\\thttp://www.nws.noaa.gov/floodsafety/states/nh-flood.shtml</a> )</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_story\">\\n\\t\\t648.5\\' is the normal, spring lake level in years when we have a normal \\n\\t\\tsnow melt and spring rains.&nbsp; This year is the first in several when \\n\\t\\tthe snow pack has been \"normal\", and the first in several years where \\n\\t\\tthe lake has begun the season at full level (or as is the case as of \\n\\t\\tthis week, 6\" above). We\\'ve had a LOT of rain in the past several weeks. \\n\\t\\tIt is pretty amazing what a difference 6\" can make when you look at \\n\\t\\tshoreline levels and docks.&nbsp; There are several docks on the lake \\n\\t\\tthat are currently close to or under water.</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_story\">\\n\\t\\tTo answer the question of why Fish &amp; Game doesn\\'t just pull more boards \\n\\t\\tout of the dam to let the level drop again, you need to consider the \\n\\t\\twhole watershed of which Merrymeeting is a part.&nbsp; The Merrymeeting \\n\\t\\tRiver and Marsh, Lake Winnipesaukee, and the Merrimack River are all \\n\\t\\talso well above normal spring levels.&nbsp; If too much water from \\n\\t\\tMerrymeeting is released too fast, it will cause flooding in the whole \\n\\t\\twatershed downstream. Therefore it needs to be released slowly and \\n\\t\\tcarefully.&nbsp; The good news is we finally have an extended forecast \\n\\t\\twith little rain and sunny days.&nbsp; The continued flow over the \\n\\t\\tsluiceway, coupled with normal evaporation, should hopefully drop the \\n\\t\\tlevel quickly. We will appreciate this water in late July when the lake \\n\\t\\tlevel is still reasonalble for water activites, unlike what we\\'ve \\n\\t\\texperienced in recent years.&nbsp; On a hot day, the lake level can drop \\n\\t\\t1\" or more just from evaporation!</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_story\">\\n\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"892\" src=\"images/2017/Level.jpg\" width=\"764\" /></p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_story\">\\n\\t\\t&nbsp;</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_header\">\\n\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"90%\" src=\"images/2017/DSC_0418.JPG\" width=\"90%\" /></p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_header\">\\n\\t\\t&nbsp;</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_header\">\\n\\t\\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"90%\" src=\"images/2017/DSC_0419.JPG\" width=\"90%\" /></p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_header\">\\n\\t\\tAs of 2-May-2017</p>\\n\\t\\t<p class=\"news_story\">\\n\\t\\tAll of the boards were added to the dam sluceway shortly after ice-out \\n\\t\\t(mid-April).&nbsp; The lake level rose quickly due to snow melt runoff \\n\\t\\tand ongoing rains.
