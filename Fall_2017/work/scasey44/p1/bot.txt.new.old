Q(noQualCrim): You probably do not qualify for this criminal matter as indigent because your household income is not less than 125% of the poverty line.
Q(noQualCrimBut): You probably qualify as indigent for this criminal matter, but because your household income is between 125% and 250% of the poverty line, you will likely be required to contribute to the costs for your legal counsel.
