    "The following bot is called \"It's freezing in...\"  It looks at five weather stations in Alaska, and if it is freezing there, and it is colder than the last check, it tweets out the temperature with the weather station.  I used weather underground weather stations for five different stations in Alaska, so there would be a better chance that it would actually be freezing there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge in this project was the regular expression.  I had a more literal string initially that worked fine on the regex site, but it wouldn't work in my code.  Instead I had to use some wild cards to get rid of the literal parts of the string. If I spent more time with it, I think I could get a more eloquent solution, but the wild card version is fine for the purpose of this bot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other challenges included getting familiar with gspread.  I felt the API was a bit incomplete and could have included more exams.  There weren't many useful tutorials either, but the API did make manipulating google spreadsheets rather easy. \n",

    "You will need to create a new Google Sheet (same instructions as [last time](https://lawyerist.com/126074/online-forms-meet-local-document-automation-cut-and-paste-coding/)). Delete rows 2-999. This is because the code below appends values to the end of your sheet. So if you fail to remove rows 2-999, values will be appended to row 1000. Additionally, it looks at the last row of the sheet for your old values. So right off the bat it will be looking at your one solitary row. Also, delete columns D through Z to avoind having to print a bunch of empty columns.\n",
